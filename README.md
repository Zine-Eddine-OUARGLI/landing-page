# landing-page

In here, I will talk about the choices I made when it came to designing the website.

For starters, I went for a blue-ish background color and all around blue-ish theme, since it fits the narrative of a computer parts / electronics webstore.

I decided to use flexbox for most of my interactions, as it makes it much easier to control how and where to put each div element (or container) in my HTML page.

I made sure to include media query so that it is responsive for any device under 768px (mobile phones).
